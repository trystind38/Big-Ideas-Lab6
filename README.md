## Overview

This simple Python program, located in the `color.ipynb` file, prompts the user to enter a color from the rainbow. The available color choices are:
- Red
- Orange
- Yellow
- Green
- Blue
- Purple

If the user enters anything other than these colors, the program will notify them that the choice is invalid and prompt them to enter a valid color again. The program is designed to keep running until a valid color is entered, providing an interactive user experience.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the program using Python:

    ```bash
    python color.ipynb
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a color.
5. Enjoy learning about the complementary colors of the rainbow!

## Example

```bash
Enter a color from the rainbow: yellow
You chose yellow!
The complementary color for yellow is purple.
```

The program will keep running until a valid color is chosen, ensuring a smooth user experience.
